<h1>The Best Movies According to Charly</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>I really love this one because it shows the dedication 
    and commitment it takes to become one of the great ones 
    in anything really. Ignoring the abuse.</p>
<h3>Apocalypse Now</h3>
<p>One of the most brutal and savage depictions of any war
    but specially I think it captures really well the essence
    of Vietnam's Hell, even though I wasn't there.
</p>
<h3>Amadeus</h3>
<p>A great story about vengeance and resentment plus Mozart's greatest
    compositions, great acting and a big twist that makes things really
    interesting.
